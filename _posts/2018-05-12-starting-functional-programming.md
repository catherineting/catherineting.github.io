In the pursuit of learning more about the software development aspect of data engineering, I'm going to begin learning about Scala, and effectively, about functional programming. Learning about a new programming paradigm would require a shifting of perspective on ways on how to solve problems. I desire to document this programming journey through this blog to serve as field notes on the things that I'd hope to get acquainted with and have a deeper understanding of along the way. I've also been wanting to get back to writing, so I hope I can achieve the things I want to get out of this. Pretty lame first post, right? Well, baby steps. For the next post, we'll get to meet FP.
