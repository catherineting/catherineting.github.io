From my very, very limited experience with Scala so far, one thing to note is that Scala is not about pure functional programming.<cut> Object-oriented programming approach is also one of the prominent features of Scala. It still takes some time for me to wrap my head around FP-style programming, and figuring out how I would do something that I want to implement in a functional way. I fall back to the imperative way sometimes, and I think you can certainly do that in Scala, but just why would you do that? This early experience is kind of like when I was trying out Node Js the first few times, and getting caught in the hole that is callbacks and asynchronous functions. If there are muscles that I'm flexing right now though, my recursion muscles are really getting some exercise.
